# PowerCon_demo
Advanced large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential for power system analysis tasks; however, their inherent limitations in handling large-scale, high-precision numerical computations prevent consistent compliance with stringent electricity regulations. We propose PowerCon, a framework that integrates an LLM with a multifunctional power AI model to facilitate interactive and reliable power dispatch. Inspired by real-world dispatch workflows, PowerCon employs a dispatcher-calculation tool architecture that enables synchronous collaboration through structured data interactions to achieve unified goals. It incorporates built-in multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning to ensure compliance with electricity regulations and improves collaborative performance through rejection sampling and supervised fine-tuning. Numerical experiments demonstrate that PowerCon effectively generalizes across multiple human instructions related to urban distribution network dispatching.
