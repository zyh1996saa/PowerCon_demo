# PowerCon_demo
We propose PowerCon, a framework that integrates an LLM with a multifunctional power AI model to facilitate interactive and reliable power dispatch. Inspired by real-world dispatch workflows, PowerCon employs a dispatcher-calculation tool architecture that enables synchronous collaboration through structured data interactions.
